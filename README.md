# tintune-mgmt
This repository holds our Intune (or is it *"Tintune"*... get it? ðŸ™‚) Management Scripts. Just like it says on the can, most of these scripts have come about as a way to automate or streamline various repeatable actions that happen in the course of managing our environment.

We are a mixed Windows / iPadOS / macOS environment. Suggestions and improvements welcome!

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the scripts here require custom functions that are included in our [PowerShell Library](https://github.com/johnclearytintern/tin-pwsh-library).

> Our school has benefited greatly from other people's open source projects over the years, and values contributing to the broader community. In this spirit we have open-source licenced this project.
